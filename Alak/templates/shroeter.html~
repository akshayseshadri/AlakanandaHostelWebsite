<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Sports in IIT Madras is played at three different levels; the intra-hostel, inter hostel and inter-IIT. Every year during December the Inter-IIT sports meet is held in one of the IITs. Representing your institute in the meet is the highest accolade any sportsperson can achieve. The Alakananda sports factory has churned out many institute players who have made us proud over the years. At present, Alakites are a very important part of the several institute teams.</p><br/>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="{{MEDIA_URL}}images/static/schroeter.jpg" title="Alak wins gold" style="height:400px;width:600px;"/><br/><br/>

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There is a huge passion for sports in Alak. Every evening after attending the soporific lectures, junta come down in huge numbers to play in the quadrangle. On one side the footer and hockey junta fight over getting more playing time in the quadi whereas on the other side you have the volley junta peacefully going about their business with no interference. Same is the case for basketball. Field games apart, Alak has two T.T tables and an upcoming and very talented table tennis team. The Fusball table has been a very welcome addition to our hostels common room. As mentioned earlier the passion for sports is also evident in the huge turnout to watch cricket, EPL and tennis matches.</p>
<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This intro to sports at Alak will not be complete without mentioning Schroeter, the inter-hostel sports tournament. This highly competitive tournament provides an opportunity to fight it out with other hostel guys and in the process lets students have some of the best fun of their sporting career. Alak has done very well in schroeter over the past few years, coming in 4th place last year. We also have the deans trophy held every year which includes games like ball badminton, chess, bridge and carom to mention a few.</p>
